-----------------------------------

!! This project is only Windows compatible !!
** Compiled with pyinstaller **

This was made as a learning project by Gavin "Zentiph" Borne and serves as a tool for anyone to use to safely download and convert YouTube videos to .mp3 and .mp4 files, given that it is done while following the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms). Of course, studying and learning from the code is encouraged!

Download
--------

To get the .exe file, navigate to the dist folder and download zytd.exe from inside. When running the file, Windows along with any other security systems will likely attempt to block the file from running. These systems will have to be disabled for the .exe file specifically, or disabled entirely for it to run.
